# Start project locally

- for development:
  - at the moment I cannot create a named volume for the frontend folder, so that we dynamically see the server in the browser. Suggest work offline for the visual part and the api should be handled via docker-compose up/down until I find a solution

- for production-ready version:
  - docker-compose up
